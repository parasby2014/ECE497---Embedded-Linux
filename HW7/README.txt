Kconfig:

I modified the correct Kconfig file as requested by the homework and added 'GPIO Buttons2'
which is basically the same as 'GPIO Buttons' except for the altered help section with my name on it
I added a picture to show proof of it working when I run a 'make xconfig'. 

uname -a:

After successfully reimaging the beagle, I get the following:

"Linux beaglebone 3.8.13-bone28 #3 SMP Fri Oct 18 11:11:16 EDT 2013 armv7l GNU/Linux"
