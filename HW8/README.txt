Did all the work for Homework 8, BUT could not get module to ever load unfortunately. 

I pushed all these files to show that I did the work like modifying hello1.c to have 2 parameters. 


When I run modprobe hello1, i get this error:

ERROR: could not insert 'hello1': Exec format error

then when I check dmesg | tail I get:

[12134.228191] hello1: disagrees about version of symbol module_layout

I spent a lot of time trying to figure this out. Other than this error, I was able to do everything else. I'm hoping not to lose too many points for not getting it working on my bone as I've put a lot of time into this.
